          Ronaldo began his senior career with Sporting CP, before signing with
          Manchester United in 2003, at age 18, winning the FA Cup in his first
          season. He would also go on to win three consecutive Premier League<br />
          titles, the Champions League and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23
          <br />, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the
          then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for
          Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million),<br />
          where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del
          Rey, and four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top
          goalscorer.<br />
          He won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016
          and 2017, and was runner-up three times behind Lionel Messi, his
          perceived career rival. In 2018, he signed for Juventus in a transfer
          <br />
          worth an initial €100 million (£88 million), the most expensive
          transfer for an<br />
          Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two Serie A
          titles, two Supercoppa Italiana trophies and a Coppa Italia, before
          <br />
          returning to United in 2021. He left in 2022. Ronaldo made his
          international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has
          since earned over 190 caps, making him Portugal's most-capped
          player.<br />
          With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the
          nation's all-time top goalscorer. Ronaldo has played in and scored
          at<br />
          11 major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at Euro
          2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final. He assumed captaincy
          <br />
          of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best
          Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football
          Federation.<br />
          The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament
          title at Euro 2016, and received the Silver Boot as the second-highest
          goalscorer of the tournament. He also led them to victory in the
          <br />
          inaugural UEFA Nations League in 2019, receiving the top scorer award
          <br />
          in the finals, and later received the Golden Boot as top scorer of
          Euro 2020.
